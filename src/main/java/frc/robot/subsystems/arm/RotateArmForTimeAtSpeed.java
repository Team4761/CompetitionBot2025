/**
 * <p> DOOMSDAY COMMAND!
 * <p> Is this name verbose? Yes. Why? Simple: we shouldn't be using this command unless we have to, so I'm going to make it annoying to type.
 * <p> This should rotate/pivot the arm at a set speed for the specified duration.
 * <p> It does NOT extend the arm.
 * <p> This should not be used if we have accurate encoders on the arm, as it is unaccurate and could potentially damage the mechanism if improperly used.
